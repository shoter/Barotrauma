---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.
- Fixed conditionals being ignored on delayed status effects.
- Fixed clients staying in an unsynced state if they rejoin while their character is dead or unconscious,
causing the camera not to follow the character and preventing the player from giving up.

- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs. 
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the 
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass 
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with 
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).

	- Fixed a bug in door syncing that caused the door states to differ between the server and clients 
	in some	subs with more complex door wiring setups.
	- Fixed clients being able to spam kick votes (duplicate votes were not counted but caused unnecessary 
	chat messages to be sent).
	- Fixed item conditions occasionally not matching exactly between the server and clients, causing 
	issues such as not clients not being able to fabricate items due to the condition being slightly

	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output 
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players 
	from choosing specific jobs

	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.

	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections

v0.7.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.
- Fixed content package setting not being saved in the settings menu.
- Item pickup sounds are only played when the controlled character picks up an item.
- Removed serverconfig.xml (the dedicated server now uses the same config file as the normal game).
- Updated the vanilla content package to version 0.7.
- Fixed entity linking in the submarine editor.
- Fixed railgun HUD crashing the game if the railgun is linked to an item that does not have an 
ItemContainer component (i.e. any item that can't contain other items).

- Fixed crashes when attempting to use a railgun controller that's not connected to anything.
- Fixed autorestart counter overlapping with the campaign map in the server lobby screen.
- Fixed characters receiving damage almost exclusively to their feet when wearing a diving suit.
- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters

- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

	- New C4, detonator and grenade sprites.
	- Optimizations and minor visual changes to the sonar display.
	- Support for hitscan projectiles.
	- Fixed ranged weapons launching projectiles with an incorrect rotation.
	- The spread of ranged weapons can be adjusted (separate values for normal spread and spread when 
	the item is being used by a character with an inadequate skill level).
	- Heavier harpoon gun recoil and impulse when the spear hits something.

- Improved item editing UI:
	- Number input fields for numeric values.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.

- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific 
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the 
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed hulls not being rendered in the submarine editor.
- Crouching is synced between the server and the clients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed diving suits and masks not providing enough oxygen when in a low-oxygen room or outside the submarine.
- Fixed message boxes being impossible to close in the launcher.

Misc:
	- Improved item interaction logic: highlighting items is more precise, with items directly under 
	the cursor taking priority.
	- Characters can be dismembered by creatures and explosions.
	- New blood particles.
	- Blood, explosion and fire decals.
	- Added an artifact that attracts creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Readded spam filter.
- Servers log the automatic temperature control setting of nuclear reactors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for multiple submarines (no full-fledged submarine vs submarine battles yet, but they're coming
in future updates!):
	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)
	- fixed monster inventory syncing (i.e. husk inventory syncing)
	- fixed server description box not being synced with clients
	- search bar for server logs
	- more server options
	- fixed the occasional "queue empty" error messages when attempting to send submarine files to players
	- characters can't be freely named anymore - they'll have the same name as the client

Items:
	- items can be equipped/unequipped by double clicking
	- longer railgun view distance
	- changes to the logic that determines which item is being highlighted - now it's much easier to
	select specific items in cramped subs
	- highlighted items glow (so it's easier to see which item you're targeting in the dark)
	- fixed an electricity bug that sometimes caused parts of the grid to not carry any power after 
	a junction box has been broken and repaired
	- option to choose the output of a signal check component when the signal doesn't match
	- fixed fire extinquishers

	- cameras: can be connected to a railgun controller (or any other selectable controller) to remotely
	view rooms or areas around the sub

Submarines:
	- the mass of a submarine depends on its size - larger submarines require more force to move around
	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)
	- changes to depth damage logic: structures with more health need more pressure before they start taking
	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:
	- stunned characters can't move items in their inventory
	- characters can run while grabbing/dragging someone
	- fixed a bug that made it impossible to spawn characters through the console in the Linux version
